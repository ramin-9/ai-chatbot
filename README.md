# AI FAQ Chatbot

This is a simple **FAQ Chatbot** built with **Flask**, **scikit-learn**, and **NumPy**. The chatbot uses a basic **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity** to match user queries to predefined questions and provide relevant answers. This project is designed to help users find answers to common business-related questions.

## Features

- Uses **Flask** as the web framework to serve the chatbot API.
- **Flask-CORS** allows cross-origin requests.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity** are used to match user input with predefined questions.
- Supports **GET** and **POST** requests to interact with the chatbot.
- Can be tested via **Postman** or integrated into a web application with **HTML/JS** frontend.
